# KDE-and-MAP
KDE and MAP used the iris, wine, winequailty, car

Maximum posterior probability + Gaussian Kernel-based probability density function estimation
I used the above four datasets to do experiments, Iris, Wine, White Wine Quality and Car Evaluation

Import library
This work uses sklearn's customize model to complete the function of KDE and MAP

Gaussian Kernel-based probability density function estimation
I preset the kernel to Gaussian, set the bandwidth between 0.1 and 2.0, and take the best result in the subsequent experimental results.
Above are my steps.

Maximum a posterior probability(MAP)
Here I inherited the value of the kernel density estimation and used the KDE function to calculate the accuracy.
