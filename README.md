# KDE-and-MAP

Maximum posterior probability + Gaussian Kernel-based probability density function estimation
I used the above four datasets to do experiments, Iris, Wine, White Wine Quality and Car Evaluation

Import library
This work uses sklearn's customize model to complete the function of KDE and MAP

Gaussian Kernel-based probability density function estimation
I preset the kernel to Gaussian, set the bandwidth between 0.1 and 2.0, and take the best result in the subsequent experimental results.
Above are my steps.
